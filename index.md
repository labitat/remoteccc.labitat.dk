We would like to invite you and like-minded people to a few days of cosy hacking on 27-28th December 2022.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As many of you know, there will be no Chaos Communication Congress this year as well, so a few Labitat members have decided to hold our own event with a few talks, live streaming of talks from other similar events, boiler room music, cosy area, working area and more.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You are part of making this event more awesome, so we would love to hear from you, if you have a talk idea, wants to help out with the last planning, setting things up 26th December or got some idea you want to set into practice at the event. Contact the working group by joining the Telegram channel listed below or write and email to <a href="mailto:info@labitat.dk">info@labitat.dk</a>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Price: It is totally free to attend, but we expect attendees to help out where needed.
